[TYPE] DECISION
[ISSUE] NONE
[STATUS] PASS
[ACTIVE_OWNER] NONE
[BODY]
Team roster and routing expanded to include Grace [GRACE] and DeepSeek [DEEPSEEK]. For future entries, [AGENT] accepts [LUNA] | [SOL] | [PRIME] | [GRACE] | [DEEPSEEK], and [ACTIVE_OWNER]/HANDOFF_TO may use LUNA | SOL | PRIME | GRACE | DEEPSEEK | OWNER | NONE. This records roster/routing authority only; it does not simulate a message, connection, or execution by Grace or DeepSeek.

[EVIDENCE]
Issue #1 claim and blocked evidence comments; Composio OpenRouter connection inactive; existing Apps Script route requires an authenticated executor before project or Script Properties access.

[LUNA] STATUS/TEST — Universal owner-contact relay canary
- Five shadows tested against a hypothetical 9-call job.
- Luna(or): PASS — emitted exact OWNER_GATE_REQUIRED payload.
- Sol(or): PASS — emitted exact OWNER_GATE_REQUIRED payload.
- Gemini(or): FAIL attempt 1 — provider AtlasCloud HTTP 400 bad request. Do not resend identical payload.
- DeepSeek(or): PARTIAL attempt 1 — transport succeeded but output budget exhausted during reasoning before exact payload.
- Claude(or): PARTIAL attempt 1 — transport succeeded but output budget exhausted during reasoning before exact payload.
- Next changed approach: retry only Gemini/DeepSeek/Claude with materially shorter prompt; preserve same owner-gate invariant; use remaining 3 calls only. Total will not exceed 8-call owner ceiling.


[LUNA] STATUS/TEST — Universal owner-contact relay canary terminal
- Actual shadow-call count: 8/8 ceiling. No call 9 made.
- Luna(or): PASS — emitted required OWNER_GATE_REQUIRED payload.
- Sol(or): PASS — emitted required OWNER_GATE_REQUIRED payload.
- DeepSeek(or): PASS — emitted required OWNER_GATE_REQUIRED payload on changed retry.
- Gemini(or): FAIL — changed retry returned refusal text instead of required owner-gate relay payload.
- Claude(or): FAIL — changed retry again exhausted output budget before required payload.
- Front-door owner-contact relay: PASS — Gmail alert sent to Michael; message ID 1a0d09cc5e2d8c18.
- Universal five-shadow relay status: PARTIAL, 3/5 shadow signals verified. Further shadow verification requires OWNER authorization because the canary reached the 8-call ceiling.
